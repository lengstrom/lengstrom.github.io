			<b>Introduction</b>
		</div>
		
		<p>PID control, or Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control, is an essential part of process control. It’s used in any area that requires adjusting a variable - whether it’s pouring water, air conditioning, or earthquake-proofing. </p>

		<p>We’re going to use PID control to move around a weighted gear. First, some terminology. A control loop is a loop in which repeated action based on input (and past input) is taken to reach a desired state. In our example, this will be the position of the gear. The current, measured state is the process variable. The desired state is the setpoint. The control variable is a variable that can be manipulated, such as the speed of a motor controlling a gear’s movement.</p>
		<br>

		<p>The entire problem that PID control attempts to solve boils down to the following problem: how can the process be manipulated by adjusting control variables that increment the process variable to equal the setpoint. For example, if our gear is at position 0, and we want to get to position 50, we could think to just set the motor at full positive power until we hit 50, and then stop the motor. Yet, physics causes there to be an overshoot in this example, as the inertia of the gear carries it forwards, beyond the 50 mark. These overshoots, whether they be due to inertia, sensor latency, or other, unknown variables, are problems PID control attempts to solve. </p>

			<b>PID Basics</b>
		</div>

		<p>In our control loop, we’ll introduce a few variables and functions. There’s the update function, $u(t)$. Then we have some constants, denoted by $K_v$, where $v$ is the variable the constant is a coefficient of. We have the error function, $e(t)$, where $e$ is the error, which is best represented as the difference between the setpoint and the process variable. Finally, $t$ is time / instantaneous time at the present. In the previous example, we would represent the update function as the following:</p>
		<br>

		<p>$$u(t) = -sgn(e(t))$$<p>
		<br>

		<p>As discussd earlier, there are a few problems with this. To alleviate these problems, we could set the motor’s power at a magnitude proportional to the size of the error. Rather than immediately going to full power, we’ll take into account how far off we are. This way, we’ll get to the desired value almost as quickly, and, hopefully, overshoot less. Our update function now looks like this (Where Kp is a constant that determines the coefficient we’re multiplying the error by):</p>
		<br>
		 
		<p>$$u(t)=K_p e(t)$$</p>
		<br>

		<p>Now, Proportional only control is nice, but it doesn’t take into account past errors - we can still improve. To fix this, we can add an integral term for the past n seconds. This way, rather than just looking at instantaneous error, we can also look at the sum of the past error, or the integral of $e(t)$. As we converge and move past the setpoint, this term will drastically decrease as larger terms are cycled out (we’re looking at the past n seconds) and smaller ones (and ones opposite in sign from the integral) are pushed in. However, when we are far away, the term will increase (in either direction, sign wise). This has important practical implications: when we’re farther away, the update term becomes larger in magnitude, regardless of the distance we’re at. So, if our gear is stuck because it’s covered in some gum (an example of steady state error, in which the process variable doesn’t move despite not being equal to the setpoint), the motor power will ramp up proportionately to power through. Thusly, our update term now looks like this: </p>
		<br>

		<p>$$u(t)=K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{t-n}^{t} e(\tau)d\tau$$</p>
		<br>

		<p>Yet, in many situations (some processes are better regulated with a PI controller, which we’ll get to later) we can do better. We can add a derivative term, in which we take the derivative of the error to look at the rate of change of the error - our update function now looks like this:</p>
		<br>

		<p>$$u(t)=K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{t-n}^{t} e(\tau)d\tau + K_d \frac{d e(t)}{dt}$$</p>
		<br>

		<p>This way, when the error ramps down, we can take that into account: as we near the setpoint, the derivative term will slow us down, acting generally in the opposite direction of the integral term and the proportional term to reduce offshoot and oscillation around the setpoint. Essentially, the derivative term accounts for predicted future error based on the current rate of change</p>

			<b>Phenomena and Terms</b>
		</div>

		<p>In this article we’re just going to look at very basic methods of manually tuning the coefficients - we’ll go into more detail about tuning in the next article. There are a variety of phenomena we’re trying to optimize, and each is affected differently by the proportional, integral, and derivative terms.</p>
		<br>

		<p>One such phenomenon is rise time, or the time it takes to reach the general area of the setpoint. Increasing proportional and integral will greatly increase rise time, as both react positively to the magnitude of the error. The derivative term acts in the opposite direction - for, as the error becomes smaller as we rise to the setpoint, the derivative of the error will be negative. </p>
		<br>

		<p>Another phenomena is overshooting, in which the process variable pushes past the setpoint. The integral and proportional terms increase overshoot, as they only take into account the current and past error. The derivative term helps curb overshoot, as it looks at the potential for future error. </p>
		<br>

		<p>Settling time, or the time it takes for the process variable to stop oscillating around the setpoint and settle, depends primarily on integral and derivative terms. A larger integral term generally increases settling time (as it carries over error), while a larger derivative term will generally decrease settling time (however, if it’s too large, it’ll increase the settling time - it’s a balance). </p>
		<br>

		<p>Steady state error, as described above, is solved by an adequately large integral term. The proportional and derivative terms have little bearing on this. </p>
		<br>

		<p>Stability is generally negatively impacted by increasing proportional and integral terms, as they can imbalance the system by taking into account past and present error. On the other hand, a larger derivative term increases stability, as it corrects for the future. </p>
		<br>

		<p>In your own PID loop, tune the parameters empirically, looking at the system for all the factors mentioned above. In the sequel to this article, we’ll look at methods of tuning PID control loops, and when to use P, PI, and PID loops.</p>
